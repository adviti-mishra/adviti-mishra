### Hi there 👋

I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Welcome to my GitHub! 

## About 

### Technology
* 👩🏻‍🏫 I spent 2 years working as an ***Instructional Aide for EECS 280 - Programming and Data Structures***.\
  (If you couldn't tell, I love teaching!)
* 👾 I was the ***Co-Director of MHacks 16***- the in-person reboot of the University of Michigan Ann Arbor's hackathon after years.\
  (The best experience of my life yet)
* 🚀 I'm on ***leadership for V1 Michigan*** - a community of student builders passionate about technology.\
  (This is where I found my people)
* 💁🏻‍♀️ I'm involved with amazing communities like ***Rewriting The Code (RTC), Society of Women Engineers (SWE), and Girls in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (GEECS).***\
  (This is where I source a lot of my inspiration from)
* 📈 I have worked on full-stack development and exploratory data analysis. I'm looking to explore different avenues in SWE.\
  (Would love to seek guidance on growing as a software engineer)
